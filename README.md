# blackjack
Note: Project is not functioning, I am adding functionality a little at a time to get used to version control
      I am also having fun creating my first GUI for a game
      
Objective:
  The player tries to beat the dealer in getting as close to 21 as possible without going over

Card Values:
  Numbered cards are their respective values
  Face cards are all worth 10
  An Ace card can be a value of 1 or 11 depending on the total value of the player's hand

Betting:
  The player will start with $500
  The player can increase their bet in increments of $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100

Doubling Down:
  The player will be able to double down if their total hand value is between 9 and 11 inclusively
  The player will be given one more card and will stand on their final hand value (e.g Hand value is 10, player doubles down and        draws a 8 then stands on 18)

Splitting:
  Players will be able to split pairs playing them each as seperate hands
